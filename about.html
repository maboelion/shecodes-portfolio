			<h1>About me</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="section-content">
			<h2>Hi, I am Mareike Boettcher, 32 years old</h2>
			<div class="container">
				<div class="row mt-5 mb-5">
					<div class="col-md-4 mt-2">
						I am currently studying "Business Psychology" remotely at the IU
						International University, Germany. I plan on finishing in 2022 with
						a Master's degree. I did my Bachelor's degree in "Industrial
						Engineering" at the University Bremen.
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4 mt-2">
						I like sports, hiking and mountains, traveling, painting and being
						creative, and also playing board games. I just generally like to try
						new things and have just recently added coding to my list of stuff I
						love doing.
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4 mt-2">
						I grew up in the North of Germany - close to Bremen - where I am
						still living with most of my family nearby. I love to travel, so I
						ended up doing two bigger travels in my life: a world trip for one
						year in 2015 and an 8-month Asia trip in 2019.
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h2>Here are some of the things I like to do:</h2>
			<div class="content">

							<span>Sports:</span>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-8">
							<img

								alt="sport"
								class="img-fluid"
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<u>Bouldering:</u>
							<br />
							Climbing without a rope and a partner. Solving puzzles with your
							mind and your body's unique abilities while working out. What's
							better than this?
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>Korbball:</u>
							<br />
							Team sports lives with the people you play with - they become
							family. Korbball is a German women's sport and it could be
							explained as a mix between Handball and Basketball.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>Swimming:</u>
							<br />
							I love water and swimming is a great way to get a full-body
							workout without sweating. Maybe the only sport that actually cools
							you down.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>Yoga:</u>
							<br />
							Perfect for body and soul. From relaxing and stretching to hard
							workouts just a wonderful addition to any kind of sport
							(especially climbing).
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>Cycling:</u>
							<br />
							A wonderful exercise while also exploring or getting somewhere.
							Definitely the better alternative to cars!
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>Hiking:</u>
							<br />
							Maybe my favorite thing to do. Especially if it involves
							mountains! Nature is best explored on foot.
						</li>

							/>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<u> Watercolor:</u>
							<br />
							The easiest access to the painting world with only a few items to
							get going and so many ways to live creativety.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u> Acryl:</u>
							<br />
							Perfect for bigger sized canvases and bold colors, dries fast -
							wonderfully divers.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u> Oil:</u>
							<br />
							Maybe my favorite, but also the hardest way to paint as it takes
							very long to dry. Blending colors in a very realistic way is
							probably easiest with this method.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u> Digital:</u>
							<br />
							My newest addition to painting. Needs the fewest amount of
							materials, is not messy at all and can be done everywhere. What a
							great way to get creative!
						</li>

							<u>Blog project:</u>
							<br />
							Last year during the Covid lockdown 2 friends and I have started a
							travel blog for the region of Northern Germany. We wanted to show
							people a way to see new things and enjoy the nature around them
							close to where they live as traveling was not possible...
							<br />

						</li>
						<li>
							<u>Personal blog:</u>
							<br />
							As I love traveling I started blogging for friends and family when
							I was away on one of my adventures. The last bigger trip was an
							Asia tour from summer 2019 until the start of the pandemic.

							<u>Gardening:</u>
							<br />
							In 2018 I bought a small garden near my home town which I am using
							together with my sister to grow veggies and fruits and hang out
							during the summer when the city feels too hot. Hammock life yiha.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>Crafting:</u>
							<br />
							I like working with my hands to create things, so I often try new
							stuff like Macram√© or just building things for the garden (new
							toilet, pergola, etc.)
